Math Game is designed for yang children to practice math and develop there math's skills. But also it is suitable for any one in elderly age to get there brains working and remembering.

## User Experience
If You could imagine You are on the top of the mountains relaxing from all the stress in the world and playing an easy math game.
The math question is easy to see. The operands are randomly picked up numbers between 1 and 25. The operator is also randomly picked up between "+"(addition), "-"(subtraction) and "x"(multiplication).

For even better User experience there is a function to count the correct and incorrect answers and the User can see how many times he need to answer correct to win and how many mistakes he is allowed.

There is a progress bar, which also improves the user experience and with every correct answer the progress bar fills up in green.

If the User has 10 correct answers he wins. The screen overlay-covers and congrats message "Congratulations! You won!" pops up and there is a button to give an opportunity to User to play again.

In case the User loses the game the message is "Sorry! You lose!", and the opportunity to play again is there, because the start over button resets the game.

### Future UX

- If I have chance in the future I would let Users to sign up and store there results.
- I would show the correct answer in case User gives wrong one.
- like that learning process would be easier.
